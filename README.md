🚀 Project Overview

This repository demonstrates the implementation of the Logistic Regression algorithm, a widely used Supervised Machine Learning classification technique, using Python. The project focuses on building a predictive model by learning from labeled training data and classifying outcomes based on probability.

Logistic Regression is commonly applied in binary and multi-class classification problems such as spam detection, disease prediction, customer churn analysis, and pass/fail classification.

🧠 Learning Type

✅ Supervised Learning

Uses labeled datasets

Learns the relationship between independent features (X) and target labels (y)

Predicts outcomes for unseen data

🔍 Algorithm Used
📌 Logistic Regression

Uses the sigmoid (logistic) function

Outputs probability values between 0 and 1

Ideal for classification problems

Efficient, interpretable, and widely used in industry
